# nopaystation_scripts

A linux bash script collection which downloads nopaystation PS Vita stuff.
There are four Scripts. One to download all \*.tsv files of NoPayStation. The other three are for downloading games, updates or all DLC of a PS Vita game.

## Requirements
* bash
* curl
* [*pkg2zip*](https://github.com/mmozeiko/pkg2zip) with the patch from [here](https://github.com/mmozeiko/pkg2zip/pull/16.patch). If you need informations how to apply patches, open an issue. Every script except **download2torrent.sh** works without the patch.
If you use openSUSE you can install pkg2zip from the Packman repository (patch included).
```bash
# zypper install curl pkg2zip
```
Make sure that executable bit is set on the scripts.
```bash
$ chmod +x download*.sh
```

## Script examples

### download_game.sh
With this script you can download a PS Vita game.
The first parameter is the path to your \*.tsv file and the second is the game's media ID.
It places the \*.zip file in the current directory.
For example:
```bash
$ ./download_game.sh /home/tux/Downloads/UPDATE.tsv PCSE00986
```
I can recommend [this](http://renascene.com/psv/) Site for searching media IDs.

### download_update.sh
With this script you can download all available PS Vita game updates.
The first parameter is the path to your \*.tsv file and the second is the game's media ID.
It places the files in a created directory from the current working directory named $MEDIAID\_update.
For example:
```bash
$ ./download_update.sh /home/tux/Downloads/GAME.tsv PCSE00986
```

### download_dlc.sh
This script downloads every DLC found for a specific media ID with available zRIF key.
It places the files in a created directory from the current working directory named $MEDIAID\_dlc.
For example:
```bash
$ ./download_dlc.sh /home/tux/Downloads/DLC.tsv PCSE00986
```
Every DLC is placed in a created directory named like the media id relative to the current directory.

### download_tsv.sh
It downloads every \*.tsv file from NoPayStation.com and creates a tar archive with the current date for it.
```bash
$ ./download_tsv.sh /path/to/the/output_directory
```
If you don't add the output directory as the first parameter, it uses the current working directory.

### download2torrent.sh
Requirements:
* pkg2zip with the patch written above in the requirements

This script downloads the game, every update and dlc found for a specific media ID with available zRIF key.
It puts the DLC and the Updates in a dedicated folder named like the generated zip and creates a torrent for the game, updates and dlc folders.
In fact it uses the three scripts from above combine them to share them easily via BitTorrent. You need to have download\_game.sh, download\_update.sh, download\_dlc.sh in your $PATH variable to get it working. 
Either you can symlink them to /home/$YOURUSER/bin/ or copy them to /usr/local/bin/.

If you want to do some additional steps after running *download2torrent.sh*, you can add a post script named *download2torrent_post.sh* to the directory where you run *download2torrent.sh* from the command line.
It has to be executable to run. *download2torrent.sh* runs the post script with the game name as the first parameter.
You can handle the parameter with the variable **$1** in your (bash) script.

For example:
```bash
$ ./download2torrent.sh PCSE00986 http://announce.url /path/to/directory/containing/the/tsv/files
```
### autoregion.sh
Requirements:
* aria2c

This script downloads every game, every update and dlc found for the specified region list with available zRIF key.
It puts the DLC and the Updates in a dedicated folder named like the generated zip and creates a torrent for each game, updates and dlc folders.
In fact it uses the four scripts from above combine them to share them easily via BitTorrent. You need to have download\_game.sh, download\_update.sh, download\_dlc.sh, download2torrent.sh in your $PATH variable to get it working. 
Either you can symlink them to /home/$YOURUSER/bin/ or copy them to /usr/local/bin/.

For example:
```bash
$ ./autoregion.sh REGION.list
